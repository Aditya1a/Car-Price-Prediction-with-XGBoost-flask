# Car-Price-Prediction-with-XGBoost-flask
This repository contains a Flask web application that predicts car prices based on user input. The model is built using XGBoost and allows users to enter details such as the car company, model, purchase year, fuel type, and kilometers driven to get an estimated price.


## Features
User Input Form: Users can input car details via a web interface.


Price Prediction: The model predicts the estimated price based on the input.


Machine Learning Model: Utilizes XGBoost for accurate price predictions.



## Technologies Used
Flask: For backend web development.

XGBoost: For the machine learning model.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation.

HTML/CSS & JavaScript: For frontend development.

Scikit-learn: For preprocessing and model evaluation.


## Usage
1. Homepage: Provides a form for users to input car details.
2.  Enter Car Details: 
      Company: The manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, Ford).
    
      Model: The model of the car (e.g., Corolla, Mustang).
